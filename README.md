rspec-mode is a minor mode for emacs to speed up development when writing tests with [rspec](http://rspec.info/)

## Keybindings

All keybindings in cucumber-mode  start with `C-c C-r` followed by an actual shortcut.

* `td`: toggle-deferred will toggle 'pending' to the name of the current test in order to defer it.
* `ra`: run all tests

## Development

Run the tests with:

cask exec ecukes
